      <a href="places-poveglia.html">Poveglia Plague Island</a>
      <a href="#">Aokigahara--The Suicide Forest</a>
      <a href="#">Island of the Dolls</a>
         <!-- - Xochimilco, Mexico -->
      <a href="#">Bhangarh Fort</a>
        <!-- //- - >/ Kilais located on the way to Alwar and Jaipur in Rajasthan in India. As per a legend there was a black magic sorcerer who cursed the residents of the palace that they all would die an unnatural death and their spirits will stay there for centuries to haunt the fort / kila forever. This fort would really freak any living mortal. One can seldom find a temporary household in the close periphery of this fort. Let us reveal you one more fact about this place. The village households found here are without roofs as there persists a popular belief and experience that the moment a rooftop is built on a house it collapses. This is said to be the most haunted place in India and amongst world's most haunted places. People are not allowed to spend the night in the fort, for obvious reasons. Believe us it is also said that anybody who has been to this place after dusk never comes back ! -->
      <a href="#">Screaming Tunnel, Niagara Falls - Ontario</a>
<!-- This one is for those brave hearts boasting hard of their fearless spirits. This is located beneath the railway track that connects Niagara falls to Toronto and New York. As per a legend about a century ago there was a farm house located just near the south entrance of this tunnel. One night the farm house caught fire and a young girl doused in flame screaming for help running wild.Nobody knows the story how the farm house caught fire. She ran through the tunnel if in case she could get some help but alas she was burnt completely and collapsed. So from that day onwards whoever tries lighting a match in the tunnel the spirit comes out screaming and haunting the person till dead.  -->



       <!-- in the Venice Lagoona small island located between Venice and Lido in the Venetian Lagoon, northern Italy. A small canal divides the island into two separate parts. -->
<!-- â€”also known as the most haunted island in the world.</a> -->
  <!-- Poveglia are nearly as pervasive as the weeds, and they read like a horror story: that so many people were burned and buried there during the black plague that the soil is 50% human ash; that local fishermen give the island a wide berth for fear of netting the wave-polished bones of ancestors; that the psychiatrist who ran the mental hospital was a butcher and torturer who went mad from guilt and threw himself from the island's belltower, only to survive the fall and be strangled by a "ghostly mist" that emerged from the ground. -->

  <!-- In 1922, the island became home to a mental hospital where a doctor allegedly experimented on patients with crude lobotomies. He later threw himself from the hospital tower after claiming he had been driven mad by ghosts. -->

  <!-- In addition to the countless others who are supposed to have met their untimely ends on Poveglia, the octagon was used by English soldiers during the Napoleonic wars to ambush French commandos. Prisoners were taken ashore and burned (this "almost became a habit," according to one history book) and -- again, this is a rumor -- destroyed French ships still decorate the bottom of the lagoon around the octagon. -->

  <!-- Venice considered itself lucky that, thanks in part to its relatively strict sanitation laws, it lost merely a third of its population during one 16th century outbreak. (The death toll on the mainland of Italy was, by comparison, far worse.) Panicked officials shipped anyone displaying symptoms of plague, be they commoners or nobility, off to the lazarettos. Doctors wore long-nosed masks stuffed with herbs in an attempt to filter sickness from the air they breathed. -->
  <!-- Work crews on nearby Lazaretto Vecchio were digging the foundation for a new museum when they came across one such grave pit, filled with the remains of more than 1,500 plague victims. -->
  <!-- Estimates that sound impossible but which I've seen on a number of websites, in a book and on that stupid episode of Ghost Adventures place the number of people who were burned or buried here in the hundreds of thousands.  -->
